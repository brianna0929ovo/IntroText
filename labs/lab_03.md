   [assignment invitation link](https://classroom.github.com/a/6s41vDSi) 
   in a new tab and accept the assignment

 - A new repository will be created for you, this repository belongs to the `comp1238w25` organization and the address will look like  
 `github.com/comp1238w25/lab3-username`

## Complete the assignment in your new repository
