# COMP1238 - Week 2 Lab - GitHub setup

## Material Covered During the Lecture:
- How computer memory works
- Short-term (volatile) RAM memory vs persistent storage
- Representation of numbers and characters in computer memory
- ASCII table
- Text and binary files

## Goals for Today
- Create a GitHub account
- Complete a simple auto-graded assignment in GitHub
- If done early, practice touch-typing focusing on accuracy rather than speed

## 1. Create a GigHub Account
If you already have a GitHub account skip to the next step.

 - Go to [github.com](https://github.com/)
 - Click "Sign Up" in the upper right corner
 - Using your private email is recommended since you will loose access to your GBC email a year after graduation.
 - You will need to choose a username. A repository address on gitHub looks like this  
 `github.com/username/repository_name`  
 Take a look at the address of this instructions file and find the prof's username.
 

## 2. Accept the Assignment on GitHub Classroom page
 - Open the 
   [assignment invitation link](https://classroom.github.com/a/oUg7dnXT) 
   in a new tab and accept the assignment.
 - You will need to select your own id/email from the list
 - This will associate your GitHub username with your GBC id/email for the rest of this semester (if you select the wrong one by mistake, email the profs to fix this)
 - A new repository will be created for you, this repository belongs to the `comp1238w25` organization and the address will look like  
 `github.com/comp1238w25/lab2-username`

## 3. Complete the assignment in your new repository
- Use the [autograder instructions](autograder_instructions.md) to find your way around your new repo
- Open lab2.txt file in that repo and complete the questions there.
    - When you save the lab2.txt file a script will automatically check it
    - You may save it multiple times, best attempt counts
    - Saving that file with any change gives you the first 40% of the grade
    - If you mess up the lab2.txt file and want to start from scratch, the template file is available here [/examples/templates/lab2_template.txt](/examples/templates/lab2_template.txt)
