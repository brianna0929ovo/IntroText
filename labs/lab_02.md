## 1. Create a GigHub Account
If you already have a GitHub account skip to the next step.

 - Go to [github.com](https://github.com/)
 - Click "Sign Up" in the upper right corner
 - Using your private email is recommended since you will loose access to your GBC email a year after graduation.
 - You will need to choose a username. A repository address on gitHub looks like this  
 `github.com/username/repository_name`  
 Take a look at the address of this instructions file and find the prof's username.
 

## 2. Accept the Assignment on GitHub Classroom page
 - Open the assignment invitation link in a new tab and accept the assignment:  
   https://classroom.github.com/a/_MFZ_dgr
 - Select your own GBC email from the list. This will associate your GitHub username with your GBC email for the rest of this semester
    - if you can't find yourself on the list, use one of the emails that look like this:  
    if.not.listed.use.this_7@then.email.prof.com  
    - if you selected the wrong email by mistake, email the prof to fix this

 - A new repository will be created for you, this repository belongs to the `f25gbc` organization and the address will look like  
 `github.com/f25gbc/lab2-username`

## 3. Complete the assignment in your new repository
- Use the [autograder instructions](autograder_instructions.md) to find your way around your new repo
- Open lab2.txt file in that repo and complete the questions there.
    - When you save the lab2.txt file a script will automatically check it
    - You may save it multiple times, best attempt counts
    - Saving that file with any change gives you the first 40% of the grade
    - If you mess up the lab2.txt file and want to start from scratch, the template file is available here [/examples/templates/lab2_template.txt](/examples/templates/lab2_template.txt)
