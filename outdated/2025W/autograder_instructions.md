# Instructions for Auto-Graded Assignments

## Saving a File to Trigger Auto-Grading  
   - Whenever you save (commit) a file in an auto-graded assignment, a script will run to evaluate your work.  
   - The script’s output can be viewed in the `Autograding Reporter` section, located under the `Actions` tab.  
   - Refer to the screenshots below for guidance.  

   ⚠️ *Note: The auto-grading process takes approximately 30 seconds. Please allow some time for it to complete.*
