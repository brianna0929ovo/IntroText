# Home Assignment - SQL practice


## Submission instructions
- Submit on D2L
   - Paste all your queries into the textbox when submitting on D2L
   - A screenshot with a query you liked the most, or found the most challenging
   - Include your name in the screenshot
- DO NOT
  - Do not publish the SQL file on your GitHub 


For exercises that are phrased as questions, include your answer as a comment and then add the query you used to get that answer. Example:
```sql
-- Student Name

-- Q1: List all assignments
SELECT * from assignments;

-- Q2: What's the title of the assignment with the earliest due date?
-- A: "Logic Gates Exercise"
SELECT * FROM assignments 
ORDER BY due_date;

...
```

## Introduction
This exercise is based on an SQLite database. In addition to the two tables we used in the labs it contains another table that is defined as follows:

```sql
CREATE TABLE rectangles (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    -- top left corner coordinates
    x REAL NOT NULL,
    y REAL NOT NULL,
    width REAL NOT NULL,
    height REAL NOT NULL,
    color TEXT -- color in a format similar to HTML & CSS
); 
```

The `REAL` data type in SQLite is an 8-byte floating point number. For us it means the coordinates and sizes can be any numbers like 3.25 or 7.

The rectangles represent rectangles on the screen. In many computer applications, including in HTML & CSS, coordinates of objects on the screen are given from the top left corner.

- Definition and data for the rectangles table can be found in 
  [rectangels.sql](../examples/sql/rectangles.sql)
- The courses and assignments tables are defined, as before, in
  [t177.sql](../examples/sql/t177.sql)
- Documentation for SQLite built-in functions can be found at 
  https://www.sqlite.org/lang_corefunc.html
- Refer to labs 11 and 12 for examples.

## Open the practice database
It's the same link we used for the labs. The DB file has been updated with new data.

## Questions - write queries for the following tasks
One point per question

1. **List all the rectangles**  
   - Take a look at the data from the rectangles table.

1. **How many rectangles are there?**  
   
1. **What color is the widest rectangle?** 

1. **What color is the tallest rectangle?**

1. **List all rectangles that are wider than they are tall**
   - That is the width is larger than height

1. **Calculate and select area of each rectangle**
   - Area is `width` times `height` (just in case)
   - Use the `AS` keyword to call the column Area

1. **What color is the largest rectangle?** 
   - Largest by area

1. **What color is the rectangle that extends the most to the right?**
   - Hint: the coordinates of the bottom right corner are  
   `x + width, y + height`

1. **Find rectangle(s) with NULL color**
   - List all the rectangles with color set to NULL

1. **List all the different colors**
   - Without duplicates

1. **List all the different _named_ colors**
   - Without duplicates
   - Do not include NULL
   - Named colors are colors like `red` as opposed to RGB colors that look like `#abcdef`
   
1. **List rectangle colors in upper case letters**
   - Like this `RED` or `#FF12B2`

1. **What is the course_id of the course with the longest name?**

1. **How many assignments are there with due dates in 2024?**

1. **Concatenate Course ID and name:**  
   - Write a query to list all courses, concatenating the `course_id` and `course_name` fields with a colon and a space between them. Like this:   
   "COMP1151: IT Essentials"
   
1. **List courses with Labs on Mondays:**  
   - Write a query to find all courses that have a lab session scheduled on Monday. Include only the `course_id`, `course_name`, and `lab_time` in the result.  
   
1. **Past Assignments:**  
   - Write a query to list all assignments with a due date before the current date.  
   
1. **How many assignments are there for each course:**  
   - Write a query to count the number of assignments for each course.  
   Hint: `GROUP BY`


### Bonus tasks
One point each, but the total grade can't be above 18.
1. **List the number of assignments per semester**  
   - Write a query that list all semesters along with the number (count) of assignments for courses in that semester.

1. **Show the red component of all the RGB colors**
   - List all the rectangles with RGB colors (those that look like `#abcdef`) and create another column showing only the red component of the color.
   - The red component is the first 2 digits after the `#`. For example, for the color `#a2cb89` the red component is `a2`.
