# Lab 10 - Airtable

## Material covered during the lecture:
- Spreadsheets
- Airtable

## The goal for today
Explore Airtable by creating a simple database with your courses and Assignments


## Step 1 - create an Airtable account
Sign up for the free Airtable account at https://airtable.com/. It does not matter which email you use to sign up. The easiest way is to sign in using your Google or Apple account.

## Step 2 - create a new database
- Don't use any templates, start from scratch
- Create 2 tables: Courses and Assignments
- Use the course code like `COMP1238` as the first column of the courses table

- In Assignments table:
  - Make sure it has a Due Date column of type Date
  - Make sure the Course column is of type "Link to Courses"
  - It is recommended that the first column is of type Formula that concatenates the course code with the assignment name. You can use a formula like this: `Course & " - " & Name`. The `&` symbol concatenates (adds) together two strings.
- In Courses table:
  - Create a Gallery view and see how it looks like with at least 2 courses filled in

## Optional tasks
- Make sure there is a Status field of type "Single Select" in the Assignments table and the selectable options include "In progress" and "Done"
- Create a Kanban view for this table. Try dragging the assignment between the columns
- Try creating a Calendar view based on the Due Date column
