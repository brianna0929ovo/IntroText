# Lecture 2: Representing Text and Numbers in Computers  
Generated from Zoom audio transcript by ChatGPT

## Overview  
- Understanding how computers represent text and numbers in memory.  
- Differences between short-term (volatile) and long-term (non-volatile) memory.  
   
## Key Concepts  
   
### Binary System  
- **Bit**: Short for binary digit, represents one of two states (0 or 1).  
- **Byte**: Group of 8 bits.  
- **Binary Numbers**: Numbers represented using base 2.  
   
### Memory Types  
- **Volatile Memory**: Loses data when power is off (e.g., RAM).  
- **Non-Volatile Memory**: Retains data without power (e.g., SSD, HDD).  
   
### Number Representation  
- **Unsigned Numbers**: Range from 0 to 255 for 8 bits.  
- **Signed Numbers**: Range from -128 to 127 for 8 bits.  
- **Fractional Numbers**: Represented using scientific notation with two integers.  
   
### Text Representation  
- **ASCII Table**: Maps numbers to characters (e.g., 65 for 'A').  
- **Control Codes**: Non-printable characters for control functions (e.g., newline).  
   
### File Types  
- **Text Files**: Interpreted as characters using ASCII.  
- **Binary Files**: Not intended to be read as text.  
   
## Historical Context  
- **Morse Code**: Early binary communication using short and long beeps.  
- **Punch Cards**: Early data storage method using holes to represent bits.  
- **Teleprinters**: Early devices for sending typed messages over long distances.  
   
## Additional Topics  
   
### Number Systems  
- **Decimal (Base 10)**: Standard human number system.  
- **Binary (Base 2)**: Used in computing.  
- **Hexadecimal (Base 16)**: Uses digits 0-9 and letters A-F.  
   
### Conversion Examples  
- **Binary to Decimal**: Sum powers of 2 for each '1' bit.  
- **Hexadecimal to Decimal**: Sum powers of 16 for each digit.  
   
### Memory and Storage  
- **RAM**: Fast, volatile memory for active processes.  
- **Storage Devices**: Include SSDs and HDDs, used for long-term data storage.  
   
## Practical Applications  
- **Text Editors**: Display bytes as characters using ASCII.  
- **File Structure**: Files are sequences of bytes, organized in directories.  
   
## Study Tips  
- Understand the difference between volatile and non-volatile memory.  
- Practice converting between binary, decimal, and hexadecimal.  
- Familiarize yourself with ASCII and its role in text representation.  
- Explore how files are structured and the difference between text and binary files.
