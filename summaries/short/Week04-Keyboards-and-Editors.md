- Focus on text manipulation and tools for software developers.  
- Emphasis on keyboard mastery, text editors, and search techniques.  
   
## Keyboard Mastery  
- **Importance**: Efficient typing reduces cognitive load.  
- **Types**:  
  - Standard 104-key layout.  
  - Variants like split, vertical, and ortholinear keyboards.  
- **Layouts**:  
  - QWERTY, AZERTY, Dvorak.

    - Exit command: `:q!`  
  - **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**: Widely used, feature-rich.  
    - Extensions and themes available.  
- **IDEs**: Integrated Development Environments like WebStorm, Pycharm.  
   
## Search Techniques  
- **Basic Search**: Use `Ctrl + F` for finding text.

- **Setup**: Modify repository settings to enable GitHub Pages.  
- **Themes**: Customize appearance using themes in `_config.yml`.  
   
## Practical Tips  
- **Multiple Cursors in VS Code**: Use `Ctrl + D` to select multiple occurrences.  
- **Version Control**: Use GitHub for managing code versions and collaboration.  
   
## Recommendations  
- **Typing Practice**: Use websites like or Keybr and Ratatype.  
- **Editor Familiarity**: Get comfortable with VS Code for industry relevance.  
- **Regex Learning**: Explore tools like Regex101 for practice.
