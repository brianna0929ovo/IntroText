# Chapter 1: A Historical Introduction to Text and Writing

As Aristotle wisely noted, to understand something, it is worthwhile to see how it came about and what its history is. This is particularly true when we look at the fundamental tools of software development. Computers, while powerful, often make things more complicated. By examining concepts like text and numbers *before* the age of computers, we can gain a simpler, clearer understanding. Many terms and concepts we use daily in computing have deep historical roots, and exploring their origins can provide valuable insight into the systems we work with.

Much of this course, especially the first part, will focus on text. This is because the vast majority of data we manage today is textual or numerical. While we deal with images, videos, and other media, crucial logical operations and data manipulation often revolve around text and numbers.

Let's begin our journey by exploring how humans have represented text and numbers throughout history, going back thousands of years.

## The Origins of Writing

When did humans first start writing? This is a fascinating question, and the answer isn't a single date but rather a process of discovery and evolution.

We have found evidence of early human markings dating back tens of thousands of years. For instance, cave paintings in France from 30,000 years ago depict animals like rhinos and include markings that some scientists believe might be related to tracking information, perhaps about animal migrations or seasons. However, these markings don't constitute writing in the sense of representing language.

Moving forward, the Ishango Bone, found in Africa and dated to about 20,000 years ago, shows clear evidence of counting using tally marks. These marks suggest early forms of numerical record-keeping, potentially used for accounting or tracking possessions, but still not true writing.

An extraordinary archaeological site in southeastern Turkey, Göbekli Tepe, dating back 10,000 years, reveals surprisingly sophisticated monumental structures built by early humans. While the stones are covered in intricate carvings of animals and symbols, no evidence of writing has been found there so far. This suggests that complex societies and structures could exist before the advent of written language as we know it.

The earliest known examples of what we definitively recognize as writing appear much later, around 5,000 years ago (approximately 3000 BC). These come primarily from clay tablets discovered in Mesopotamia, in cities like Uruk (near modern-day Warqa, Iraq), located in the fertile region between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers known as the Fertile Crescent.

These early tablets are often not grand literary works but rather practical documents, such as receipts for goods like barley and beer. The system of writing used is called **cuneiform**, a term derived from the Latin word for "wedge-shaped."

## Cuneiform: Writing on Clay

The development of cuneiform is tied to the medium used: clay. Initially, people drew lines and shapes on wet clay. However, they quickly discovered that pressing a stylus into the clay was much faster and more efficient than drawing lines. This led to the characteristic wedge shapes.

The stylus was typically made from a reed, a plant similar to bamboo, cut to have a square or triangular end. By pressing this end into the clay at different angles and depths, scribes could create a variety of wedge shapes. Over time, the symbols evolved from more pictographic representations to abstract combinations of wedges, adapting to the speed and ease of the pressing technique.

Early cuneiform symbols often represented syllables (like 'ma', 'la', etc.), similar to the modern Japanese Hiragana or Katakana alphabets, rather than individual letters or whole words.

## Numbers in Cuneiform

The Mesopotamians also developed a sophisticated system for writing numbers using cuneiform. On early tablets, a small round impression often represented 'one', and a crescent shape represented 'ten'. Numbers were formed by combining these symbols additively, much like Roman numerals.

However, their system evolved into something more complex and powerful: a **sexagesimal** (base-60) system. While they used symbols for 1 and 10, they grouped numbers up to 59. For numbers 60 and above, they used a positional system, similar to our base-10 system, but with 60 as the base.

For example, while we understand the number 233 as 2 * 100 + 3 * 10 + 3 * 1, a cuneiform representation might use symbols for '2', '23', and '3' in sequence to represent 2 * 60² + 23 * 60¹ + 3 * 60⁰. This allowed them to represent very large numbers efficiently, which was crucial for accounting and complex mathematical calculations.

Why base 60? One common theory is that it relates to counting using fingers. You can count to 12 using the bones/segments of the fingers on one hand (excluding the thumb) and then use the fingers of the other hand to count how many sets of 12 you've completed (up to 5 sets). 12 segments * 5 fingers = 60. Remnants of this system persist today in our measurement of time (60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour) and angles (360 degrees in a circle).

## Other Ancient Number Systems

For comparison, let's briefly look at other ancient numerical systems.

**Egyptian Numerals:** The ancient Egyptians developed a system using hieroglyphs for powers of 10: a stick for 1, a heel bone for 10, a coiled rope for 100, a lotus flower for 1,000, and so on, up to a figure representing a million. Numbers were formed by repeating these symbols. While visually appealing, this system was less suited for complex arithmetic compared to the Babylonian positional system.

**Roman Numerals:** The Roman system uses letters (I, V, X, L, C, D, M) to represent values. It's primarily additive (VI = 5 + 1 = 6) but also uses subtraction in some cases (IV = 5 - 1 = 4). While familiar, it's cumbersome for arithmetic and lacks a zero or positional value beyond simple grouping. Examples like the number LII (52) on the entrance gates of the Colosseum in Rome or MCM (1900) often seen in movie credits illustrate their use for numbering and dating.

## The Power of Written Stories

While early writing served practical purposes like accounting, it quickly evolved to record history, laws, and literature. Around 4,000 years ago (2000 BC), we find tablets containing the Epic of Gilgamesh, one of the earliest known works of literature.

The Epic tells the story of Gilgamesh, a powerful but initially tyrannical king of Uruk, his friendship with the wild man Enkidu, Enkidu's death, and Gilgamesh's subsequent quest for immortality. It includes themes of friendship, mortality, and the search for meaning, and even contains a flood narrative strikingly similar to later biblical accounts. The story concludes with Gilgamesh accepting his mortality and deciding to immortalize himself by having his story inscribed on the walls of his city – a testament to the enduring power of writing.

Tragically, despite being inscribed on durable clay tablets, the story of Gilgamesh was eventually forgotten for nearly two millennia after the decline of the Babylonian civilization. It was only rediscovered and deciphered by archaeologists in the 19th century, highlighting the fragility of knowledge transmission even with written records.

## Writing Systems vs. Languages

It's important to distinguish between a writing system and a language. Just as the Latin alphabet can be used to write English, French, German, Spanish, and many other languages, ancient writing systems were often adapted to different spoken languages.

A famous example is the Van inscription in eastern Turkey, carved into a mountainside on the orders of Xerxes the Great around the late 6th century BC. This inscription presents the same text in three different languages: Old Persian, Elamite, and Babylonian. All three are written using cuneiform scripts, but they represent distinct languages. The Old Persian cuneiform script was actually more alphabetic or syllabic than the older Babylonian logographic/syllabic system. This trilingual inscription was crucial for deciphering cuneiform languages in the 19th century, much like the Rosetta Stone was for Egyptian hieroglyphs.

The history of alphabets shows a clear lineage for many modern scripts. Most writing systems in Europe, the Middle East, and parts of Africa can be traced back to ancient Egyptian scripts, which influenced the Proto-Sinaitic script, which in turn led to the Phoenician alphabet. The Phoenician alphabet spread and evolved into the Greek alphabet, which then gave rise to the Latin (used for English, French, etc.) and Cyrillic (used for Russian, Bulgarian, etc.) alphabets. Another branch from the Phoenician or a related script (like Aramaic) led to the Hebrew and Arabic alphabets.

Other writing systems developed independently, such as the Chinese script (which evolved from oracle bone script) and the Mesoamerican scripts (like Mayan). More recent inventions include Hangul, the Korean alphabet developed in the 15th century, and the Canadian Syllabics, developed in the 19th century for indigenous languages.

## The Printing Revolution

For millennia, written documents were produced by hand, whether inscribed on clay, painted on papyrus, or copied onto parchment or paper by scribes. This made books and written materials rare and expensive. The invention of printing revolutionized the distribution of information.

Early forms of printing existed long before the modern printing press. Cylinder seals, like the one belonging to Queen Puabi from Mesopotamia (~4,500 years ago), were rolled onto clay to create repeating patterns or inscriptions, functioning like early stamps. Woodblock printing, where an entire page is carved into a wooden block, inked, and pressed onto paper, was used in China as early as the 9th century AD (e.g., the Diamond Sutra, 868 AD). While effective for mass-producing a fixed text or image (like the famous Great Wave off Kanagawa woodblock print from the 1830s), this method was inflexible; any error or change required carving a new block.

The key innovation was **movable type**, where individual characters are cast as separate pieces and can be arranged and rearranged to form different texts. Movable type was also invented in China centuries before it appeared in Europe, notably by Bi Sheng in the 11th century using ceramic type. Metal movable type was developed in Korea in the 13th century.

However, it was Johannes Gutenberg in the mid-15th century in Europe who developed a comprehensive system for printing with movable metal type that sparked a revolution. Gutenberg, a goldsmith and jeweler by trade, had the expertise to work with metals and create precise molds. His system involved creating durable metal type pieces (an alloy of lead, antimony, and tin was found to work well) using a punch and matrix system, developing an oil-based ink suitable for printing, and adapting a screw press (like those used for wine or olives) for printing.

Gutenberg's most famous product was his Bible, printed around 1455. While often seen as a tool for mass literacy, the Gutenberg Bible was a luxury item, produced in a relatively small run (around 180 copies) and designed to imitate expensive handwritten Bibles. Its significance lay not in making books cheap immediately, but in demonstrating the viability and quality of mass production.

The economic impact was profound. The graph showing the price of books in Britain reveals a dramatic collapse in cost after the introduction of the printing press. This technological shift enabled the mass production and distribution of information on an unprecedented scale. Within decades, printing presses spread across Europe, contributing significantly to the Renaissance and the Protestant Reformation by making texts, including religious works and new ideas, far more accessible.

## Terminology from the Printing Press

The printing industry gave us several terms that are still used today, particularly in computing and design:

*   **Typeface:** The design or style of a set of characters (e.g., Times New Roman, Arial). It comes from the "face" of the metal "type" piece that makes the impression.
*   **Font:** In traditional printing, a font was a complete set of type of one size and style (e.g., 12-point Times New Roman Bold). In digital contexts, "font" and "typeface" are often used interchangeably, or "font" refers to the digital file containing the typeface.
*   **Font Weight:** Refers to the thickness of the strokes in a typeface (e.g., light, regular, bold).
*   **Serif vs. Sans-serif:** **Serif** fonts have small decorative strokes or "feet" at the ends of characters (like the fonts used in many books, e.g., Times New Roman). They originated from imitating handwritten styles. **Sans-serif** fonts (sans means "without" in French) lack these strokes and tend to have a cleaner, more modern look (like Arial or Helvetica).
*   **Typesetting:** The process of arranging type to prepare text for printing. This term is still used for software that prepares text for publication (e.g., Adobe InDesign).
*   **Uppercase and Lowercase:** These terms originated from how metal type was stored. Capital letters, used less frequently, were kept in a case (a shallow box) stored on an **upper case** shelf, while small letters, used more often, were kept in a case on a **lower case** shelf.

## The Advent of Typewriters

The typewriter, which became widespread in the late 19th century, represented another step in making mechanical writing accessible for individual use. While printing presses produced multiple copies, typewriters produced a single, mechanically written document.

Why invent typewriters when handwriting was common and printing existed? One significant driver seems to have been the need for legible, standardized text in business and official communication. Just as doctors' handwriting can be notoriously difficult to read today, varied handwriting styles in the 19th century could be a barrier to efficient communication, especially as literacy rates and the volume of paperwork increased. Typewriters produced text that looked like print, easily readable by a wider range of people.

Typewriters also introduced concepts that carried over to computers:

*   **Carriage Return:** On a mechanical typewriter, the paper is held in a "carriage" that moves horizontally as you type. At the end of a line, you perform an action (often pulling a lever) that simultaneously moves the carriage back to the left margin and advances the paper down one line. This action is the "carriage return." The term and the concept of moving to the start of the next line persist in computing, and the symbol on the "Enter" or "Return" key on many keyboards visually represents this action: an arrow moving down and then left.
*   **Monospace Fonts:** Early typewriters had a mechanical constraint: each character key had to move the carriage the same fixed distance. This necessitated the use of **monospace** fonts, where every character (from a narrow 'i' to a wide 'w') occupies the same horizontal space. While variable-width fonts (like those used in books or on webpages) are common, monospace fonts remain essential in computing for tasks like writing code, where consistent alignment is crucial for readability.

From ancient wedge shapes pressed into clay to the mechanical keys of a typewriter, the history of text and writing is a story of human ingenuity driven by the need to record, communicate, and distribute information. These historical developments laid the groundwork for the digital text we interact with constantly in the age of computers.
